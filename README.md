# Typing-Speed-Test
A typing speed test built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It displays randomly generated jumbled word sentences for the user to type. The app calculates the total time taken and words per minute (WPM) to measure typing speed. A clean UI and real-time feedback make it simple and effective for practice and testing.
